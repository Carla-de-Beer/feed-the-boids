// Evolutionary steering.
// A game that allows you to add food to the system in oder to determine which boid becomes the fittest in the population.

// Each boid's health level is adversely affected when it does not eat, or eats poison.
// Eating a green dot allows for an increase in a boid's health level.
// Based on Daniel Shiffman's Coding Train video example:
